denman told rostenkowski an illinois democrat he backed aspects of the bill such as one backing new talks under the gatt and one excluding protection for the textile industry but denman disagreed with other provisions which would require president reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the u s and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices denman told rostenkowski that gatt regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is gatt approved he said if the congress makes retaliatory action mandatory then the united states would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws saying in the last resort any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest otherwise he said the risk would be counter reaction by trading partners of the united states i e retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the united states denman also said congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring u s firms changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally they cannot be imposed by the united states alone on the world trading system he said house leaders have rejected a plan by textile state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed

mcleod young weir ltd transportation analyst tony hine commented the two acquisitions fit with a larger move by u s companies embroiled in a take over or restructuring to sell off their canadian units

participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the federal reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy but even wednesday when fed funds were below six pct the dollar strong and oil on the soft side bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs he said in addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy golden gate futures president norman quinn said the beginning of april could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace the market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in japan on april quinn said quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested if japanese investment in u s securities does materialize at the start of japan s fiscal year domestic funds may also flow into the bond market he said we could get a stiff rally possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to pct compared to the current yield of about pct quinn said in the meantime even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures the treasury s announcement of a billion dlr refunding operation did little to move cash

arabia reshapes economy higher world oil prices coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity could lift saudi arabia s economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits bankers and diplomats said the months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct the first rise since but the economists said this will be possible only if the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec succeeds in defending world oil prices and if saudi arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long saudi arabia is now keeping production down to defend opec s newly established dlr a barrel benchmark price oil minister hisham nazer told reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day bpd well down on saudi arabia s opec quota of mln set for the first half of king fahd has stamped his personal authority on opec s new found determination to defend prices in a move western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom s need to secure a stable source of income for its economy saudi arabia still the world s largest oil exporter is a hugely wealthy country but the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll economists estimate gross domestic product fell pct last year and pct in oil revenue last year when prices briefly dipped below dlrs per barrel probably totalled no more than billion dlrs compared to a peak billion in austerity is still the watchword but saudi arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession the saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects a diplomat said in the short term the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves still put at around billion dlrs but such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term it also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to tough it out on the oil front even if that means a short term depletion of reserves the budget deficit is targetted at a huge billion riyals or pct of total outlay the budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out commerce minister suleiman abdulaziz al salim told saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year it therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy he said reserves were built up during the late s and early s when saudi arabia s breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary the shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the kingdom s private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom modern techniques of cost control have been introduced markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back the expatriate workforce has fallen sharply the number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but saudi banks hit hard by non performing loans to the corporate sector have become highly selective in extending new credit government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation s industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit as saudi arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector one of the biggest tasks will be to

with taiwan and korea is expected to widen this year despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries economists said the surpluses that taiwan and korea ran with the u s in will get bigger this time next year the u s will be screaming at those countries about their exports said steve cerier of manufacturers hanover trust co taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the u s after japan and canada while korea is the seventh largest faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in congress the reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against taiwan and korea urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade the thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries nics amid signs the dollar s steep drop against the currencies of japan and most ec nations previously the main focus of the u s drive to cut its trade gap is beginning to close the competiveness gap for american goods u s treasury secretary james baker said recently that he expects a reduction in japan s trade surplus this year but u s manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to taiwan and korea whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark as major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs taiwanese and korean exporters are well placed to take up the slack in the fashionable comment in washington was japan bashing now it s nic bashing said robert chandross of lloyds bank plc asia s four main nics hong kong south korea singapore and taiwan accounted for almost one fifth of the overall billion dlr u s merchandise trade deficit for the u s trade gap with taiwan rose to billion dlrs in from billion in while the bilateral trade deficit with south korea grew to billion from billion and preliminary u s data show that the growth trend is continuing the u s trade shortfall with taiwan was billion dlrs in january up pct from a year earlier the gap with korea was mln dlrs up pct from a year ago lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions korea said it is choosing many of the items on which the u s wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation still south korean trade minister rha woong bae said last week that korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its billion dlr foreign debt for its part taiwan said in january that it will cut tariffs on goods sometime in the second half of and try to diversify exports but vice economic minister wang chien shien said last month that he still does not expect taiwan s trade surplus with the u s will fall in the nics have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods but korea is raising its profile in the area of big ticket manufactured goods notably cars korea expects its auto exports mostly for north america to balloon to units in from zero in the nics exports are almost all manufactured goods when their exports rise it hits the heart of the u s manufacturing base it cuts directly to us and to our customers said bob wendt manager for economic studies at bethlehem steel corp the u s takes pct of korea s computer products exports pct of its electrical appliances and pct of its telecommunications equipment a recent study by morgan guaranty trust co says taiwan and south korea are the most pressing trade issue for the u s while hong kong and singapore run trade surpluses with the u s these are offset by their deficits with other countries but taiwan and to a lesser extent south korea stand in marked contrast both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the u s and major overrall trade and current account surpluses the morgan study says morgan expects taiwan s overall trade surplus to grow to billion dlrs in from billion last year and korea s to increase to billion dlrs from billion concern about the nics is not confined to the u s a lot of korea and taiwan s exports to the u s have been at japan s expense said richard koss at general motors corp february s paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted nics to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies but this two pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and in any case will only work with a sizeable lag economists say the u s has not said how much it thinks the taiwan s and korea s currencies should climb the taiwan dollar which is pegged to the u s dollar has risen about pct since september while the korean won has risen about five pct but in real terms the taiwan dollar has been flat against the u s unit and the won has lost seven pct economists say we ve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes said bethlehem steel s wendt and so far u s pleas for taiwan and korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect moreover it is uncertain how far u s protectionism will get given the administration s free trade stance it s hard to see that anything will be passed much before

higher nominal interest rates but a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year s end and next year it said the association said

should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower marginal rate analysts said it should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered a western diplomat commented the naira has depreciated against the dollar by pct since the auctions known as the second tier foreign exchange market sfem began last september at last week s session the nigerian currency was fixed at to the dollar the third fall in a row they were clearly worried and this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend the diplomat said the central bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly not weekly beginning on april it was not immediately clear whether next thursday s scheduled session would still take place nor if the bank was planning to double the mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira if the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session high demand could undermine the objective of the new system analysts said although bidding banks will now pay what they offered the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate the lowest successful bid sfem is a central part

successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention economists said economists speculated that g countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling u s and west german interest rates further when they meet for the imf interim committee in april the recent round of monetary accommodation by the bundesbank and the bank of japan and the firming of the federal funds rate are significant they mark an uncoupling of movements in u s and foreign interest rates salomon bros inc said in a recent study it said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar s fall these spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized west german bundesbank president karl otto poehl encouraged the u s not to cut interest rates in january when the bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point to avoid weakening the dollar west german economists see room for further cuts in leading west german rates if the dollar resumes its decline it s not a taboo peter pietsch spokesman for commerzbank ag said but most economists see room for a cut in west german rates only in the first half of the year as re emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year the bundesbank s average yield of public paper is already nearing last year s low last week yields fell to around pct not far from the low of pct posted in mid april economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer term paper such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long term rates which has become more pronounced since the bundesbank lowered its discount rate it might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the bundesbank s central bank money stock aggregate but conflicting with this trend are plans to increase west german tax cuts part of the paris currency pact designed to meet u s demands for faster west german growth this move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing this may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak but demand could emerge if rates begin rising economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth and higher than expected spending josef koerner chief economist of the west german ifo institut said in a newspaper interview he expected tax revenue to be some billion marks below estimates by the west german government in november any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up but coupled with other factors such

informally to discuss progress made since the latest gatt round was launched in punta del este uruguay last september yeutter said at least people seem to be going down the same road but how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely there seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and a more common understanding of how we are going

amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy he said he said the long term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas this would help agriculture because some its inefficient non productive segments would stop operating he said individual segments in many countries may lose in the process but it should result in a more rational system of world wide production within or years he said it is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the u s is

referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years these include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on old bass strait oil found before september to pct from pct and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last september he said the industry through the apea has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and australia s relatively low exploration levels while nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime i am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes which leave government revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas evans said he said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation rrt legislation now before parliament in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible as previously reported rrt is a tax of pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects apea has said it is not a

evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum apea had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development the council said it said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by evans but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax rrt legislation evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure the government s unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which rrt applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based the apea council said the government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers

than years will vote wednesday on its possible dissolution the directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month citing falling volume and increasing costs sources close to the organization told reuters the pullout of growmark inc which holds more than pct of the capital stock led to the call for dissolution the possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership ironically it was growmark at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators that founded illinois cooperative futures on december but growmark became affiliated last year with archer daniels midland of decatur ill and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies adm growmark with that relationship growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative said tom mulligan president of the co op membership in the company which mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives has declined from in a notable loss was agriindustries of iowa which became affiliated with cargill inc illinois co op s other members include such regional cooperatives as indiana grain based in indianapolis goldkist of atlanta ga midstates in toledo ohio farmland industries in kansas city mo farmers commodities des moines and harvest states in minneapolis some observors said the demise of illinois cooperative futures co is a serious blow to the cooperative system instead of banding together the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways said the floor manager of one cash house at the chicago board of trade such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant he said don hanes vice president for communications with the national council of farm cooperatives said cooperatives exist today down from five years ago the period we ve gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch he said there s been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co ops one problem he said is the co ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export rather than exporting it themselves losing potential profits but exporting grain requires heavy investments and the multi million dollar loss posted six years ago by farmers export co a co op set up to export grains served to make folks gun shy hanes said mulligan said he believes the dissolution if it is approved is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in u s agricultural economics a grain dealer at one member co op said the futures arm was a convenience something that saved us a little bit of money its dissolution will force us to change our way of doing business we re sorry to see the co op go by the wayside he said but there are lot of people out there to do business with there are plenty of capable firms steven w cavanaugh vice president for grain marketing with indiana grain said he would prefer to trade futures through a chicago based cooperative in terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals there would be economic savings he said but added the times change and with changing times come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability i would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble it is a sound healthy organization in the year ended february the illinois cooperative reported income of mln dlrs and members equity or net worth of mln dlrs the annual report for the most recent year has not been filed under the cooperative system income from operations is

dlrs patronage refunds in the year ended february totalled mln dlrs you re dealing with substantially lower volume mulligan said lower volume translates into higher costs according to the company s annual report growmark owns pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of illinois cooperative futures co mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital growmark is

about a third of the cash payable would be met from bp s own resources the remainder would come from new borrowings partly from banks under a four year committed revolving credit facility and partly

largest single asset full ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be made without the limitations of a minority interest bp also believed the acquisition represented the optimum use of its financial resources it was confident oil prices were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the investment walters added that it also felt that due to management changes in

recent announcement that it intended to dispose of its remaining pct stake in bp sometime in the financial year analysts said analyst paul spedding of brokers kleinwort grieveson noted that any effect on the government sale of its stake in bp would depend on the reaction of the markets the deal would probably push bp s gearing up to around pct from pct currently he said however with the likelihood that oil prices would not repeat last year s rapid drop the prospects for standard returning to profitability this year and bp benefitting from its cash flow were good standard was a high cost oil producer the analysts noted spedding noted that it needed about dlrs a barrel to make money and at about dlrs a barrel revenue from production and its downstream activities would push it comfortably into surplus bp initially took a stake in standard following the discovery of oil in alaska s prudhoe bay in bp had inadequate distribution facilities in the u s while standard which was strong on marketing and refining was short on crude oil the analysts said that bp had promoted a major management reorganisation of standard in the past year the probability that much of the shake up at standard was now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the tender offer spedding said bp s willingness to take hard decisions such as major balance sheet write offs and the sale of

wait to see how the unions wage round goes in west germany unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation economists said ute geipel economist with citibank ag said if the bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands as a result the bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process geipel said in the current round the country s most powerful union the ig metall representing metalworkers and engineers is demanding a shortening of the working week to hours from the present and an accompanying five pct increase in wages the engineering employers association gesamtmetall is offering to bring in a hour week from july and give a two stage wage increase a pct rise from april this year and another pct from july the agreement forged by ig

first interstate the fourth largest california bank and the nineth largest nationwide owns banks in western states and has franchise operations in four additional states bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large u s or foreign banks looking to quickly move into the lucrative california market and the west coast region while declining specifics on his corporate strategy when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan pinola replied that s undoubtedly a fair statement it would be almost naive not to think that pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as opportunistic he said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain then add management to restore profitability or for banks in states where first interstate already operates then cut costs by combining resources the exception he said would be texas where he said most of the banks are already well managed but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for bankamerica saying only we continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us banking analysts however consider another first interstate bid at bankamerica a long shot not likely to happen any time soon pinola called his decision last

well managed company he said he added however first interstate at the moment has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition first interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its rocky mountain states where energy real estate and agriculture dominate the economy asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked he said i don t think it has bottomed out because i think most of the problems are

pressure which threatens the world trading system it said in an annual report the fundamental problem the size of the u s federal budget deficit could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt it said gatt also predicted world trade would grow by only pct in a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years gatt experts urged washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit higher private savings lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit raising u s trade barriers would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit it would however increase inflation and reduce world trade it said the basic cause some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit would remain the report said gatt economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in japan and some west european nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar risk of higher u s inflation concerns over third world debt management and looming protectionism the report also said imbalances in the current accounts of japan west germany and the u s had increased in the most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies it added thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year the report said gatt warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the u s inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates which in turn would adversely affect world trade but the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the united states despite the dollar s depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive it suggested that resources idle in the u s both human and in underutilised factories were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad world trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in about half of the rate of the previous year trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct continuing a stagnant

one day after the reagan administration s economic policy council decided to take retaliatory action against japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages one designed to pep up japan s sagging economy and imports in the short term the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over dependence on exports for growth but government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day nakasone

securities companies operating in london s financial city when they come up for renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up japan s markets to foreign competition government sources said we can t say yes we are going to do it revoke licences but this is definitely being considered an official said his comments came after the government was formally urged today by a cross section of influential mps to take joint retaliatory action with the united states against japan britain has grown increasingly impatient with japanese trade practices there s a sense of urgency here now but the emphasis is on securing not undermining our interests in japan another government official told reuters prime minister margaret thatcher said on thursday that britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the financial services act and the banking bill to retaliate against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access she clearly had japan in mind government sources said the u k last year showed a trade defict with japan of billion stg official figures show a parliamentary motion signed by mps today urged the u k government to coordinate action with the president of the united states and through the department of trade and industry to suspend all further applications from japanese communications companies for equipment approval by the british approvals board for telecommunications and all further applications from japanese financial institutions for licences until authorities in japan stopped imposing what the mps called restrictive conditions on the bid by cable and wireless plc cawl l and its u s and japanese partners for a stake in japan s international telecommunications market the motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross section of mps reflecting the strength of feeling inside parliament parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on the conservative government to take firm action officials said another option now being considered by the u k is to refuse issuing new banking licences to japanese institutions that could be done under the government s proposed banking bill now moving through parliament japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal in london of which are banks in tokyo london based firms are authorised to do financial business officials said the new financial services and banking acts offer britain an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied under legally binding international trade agreements the financial services act gives trade and industry secretary paul channon power to stop firms from engaging in investment banking and insurance one official said this point has been made to the japanese at official level a number times the official added britain and france are now working together to urge that the european community take collective action against japan but by working within ec treaties another official said british trade minister alan clark said this week in a radio interview that the european community should build barriers against japanese imports through certification procedures similar to those facing european exporters in japan there comes a point where you cannot resist any longer he said adding such barriers can t be put in place overnight clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade strikes at the basis of whether british industry is to have a fair access to an extremely large market japan which is itself in a very dominant position in certain aspects of our own domestic market it is really a question of fairness the situation is only likely to worsen following news that japan s trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more than pct in february year on year to billion dlrs from

canadian banks to do the same levesque beaubien inc toronto based bank analyst donna pulcine told reuters they banks like to appear to be conservative said pulcine and if a major bank puts loans on a non performing basis and the canadian banks don t there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non performing and another bank is not wood gundy inc bank analyst patricia meredith said any willingness by a major brazilian bank creditor such as citicorp cci to declare its brazilian loans non performing rather than let brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks in order to make that strategy work they citicorp have to have the support of the other banks said meredith bank analyst michael walsh at first marathon securities ltd said at least one canadian bank which he declined to identify wants to put the brazilian loans on a non performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position canadian banks are owed about seven billion canadian dlrs by brazil which late last month suspended interest payments on its billion u s dlr foreign bank debt banks in canada although allowed to wait up to days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non performing usually move on such loans within days they could therefore delay action on the brazilian

canadian banks from a move to declare the brazilian loans non performing they said brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks fiscal year end on october thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income from what brazil has said it is quite likely the banks will get the money said meredith my outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full

made cars and electronic goods may upset west european officials but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest trade row between the united states and japan japan s huge trade surplus is a sore point in west europe as it is in the united states but u s charges of unfair trade practices involving computer microchips leave europeans cold the european community ran a billion dlr trade deficit with japan last year and seeks redress when it feels japanese trade policy hurts europeans diplomats and economists said but only in britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the u s to do something about japan s huge trade surplus the ec is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the u s said martin wolf director of studies at the trade policy research centre in london basically their policies are pretty much the same but that did not mean europe would support the u s or that the ec would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the u s dispute to press its own claims wolf said basically europeans have a different approach to trade problems he said in the u s people talk about fair trade but not here he added in the u s it all has to do with the general ethic of free competition while in europe the general approach is that liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich wolf said this basic u s attitude explains washington s tendency to impose so called countervailing duties an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair in western europe the approach to trade disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation wolf said in the latest u s japan trade row president reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected japanese electronic goods by as much as mln dlrs alleging that japan has failed to abide by a u s japan pact on microchip trade but the european community has challenged the agreement as a violation of general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt practices that discriminates against its microchip producers it follows that they re not likely to rally to the side of the united states in defence of the agreement said wolf although british parliamentarians are

imbalances in a statement issued after that meeting ec foreign ministers deplored japan s continued trade imbalance and appealed for a greater japanese effort to open up its markets ec external trade commissioner willy de clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with japan in the ec diplomats accredited to the ec in brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to

minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first days of the month though this was above the march requirement of billion actual holdings at the weekend were billion to meet the daily average dealers said banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to billion today and tomorrow but liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the bundesbank s offer for sale of treasury bills on friday this provides a rate of pct for three day deposits and is an effective floor to the market though some liquidity from bills bought on thursday flowed back into the market today the bulk would not return until tomorrow the start of the new month dealers said dealers said the large banks which they did not name commanded short term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so with a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills draining liquidity for three days when other banks sought funds rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return one senior dealer said the bundesbank with advanced knowledge of the market s needs should

this amount he said if the bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses tomorrow it will be different call money will fall back to pct or so but the bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates given the delicate state of currency markets international central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies including the mark dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone contributing to downward pressure on the dollar the whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct in that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular the senior dealer said dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between pct or four pct this is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between

pct wardair international ltd is third with about nine pct analysts believe pacific western s aggressive and cost conscious chairman rhys eyton will develop the true potential of the former cp air which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate canadian pacific ltd they said cp air s management style had been not much different from that of air canada formed years ago because neither airline was held accountable to its owners not that long ago maybe even just six months ago these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line said bradley but with cp air being run by eyton it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return and air canada is on the verge of going that way he said cp air always

billion dlrs in it has a debt of more than billion dlrs although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to the public the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing air canada to pay more attention to finances analysts said it recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit in excess of mln to mln dlrs for however this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all canadian airlines had a good year in analysts said tourists came to canada in record numbers last year attracted by the relatively weak canadian dollar and expo in vancouver which alone had more than mln visitors for the next few years most analysts see three six pct air traffic growth and they expect profits will come from cost cutting and careful spending peter friend of walywn stodgell cochran murray ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add air canada to their portfolios as a blue chip investment but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain the airline with something to lose will be air canada at one time it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else s friend said many analysts recommend that investors buy

the threatened trade war between the united states and japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin but they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip or whether this week s falling share prices mark the start of a bear market it s the billion dollar question said richard o brien economist at american express international bank in london japan s trade surplus billion dlrs last year has poured into share and bond markets around the world and funded a good chunk of the huge u s budget deficit around a third of any new sale of u s treasury bonds has been bought by the japanese however japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the united states lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit the counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the u s increases duties on japanese electronic goods may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit and if the u s trade deficit does fall the japanese will have less money to invest to entice u s investors to fill the gap that would be left if the japanese stopped buying u s bonds interest rates would have to soar o brien said the subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets a year ago we could be pretty confident about the markets said o brien now it is much less certain buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy but the world economy with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations a massive load of

fourth quarter reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of mln dlrs the fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a charge of mln dlrs on certain other assets taken mainly in the third quarter dome said the billion dlr fourth quarter charge resulted from a year end accounting change made under new full cost accounting guidelines by the canadian institute of chartered accountants the company said it previously determined a write down of conventional oil and gas properties was not required at september under the previous method of calculating the limitation of oil and gas values dome said the most significant accounting change under the new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in calculations instead of escalating price forecasts terms of dome s proposed debt restructuring plan preclude the company from making an accurate estimate of future financing costs which are used in the new accounting calculations it said as a result dome adopted current prices and costs and a pct discount factor in the calculations which substantially conform with accounting rules prescribed by the u s securities and exchange commission the company said dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural gas segments fell by billion dlrs to a loss of billion dlrs from prior year earnings of mln dlrs dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas operating income was due to write downs totalling billion dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of dome s offshore drilling fleet in the beaufort sea also contributed to the decline it said earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by pct to mln dlrs from mln dlrs in cash from operations dropped to mln dlrs from year ago mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to mln dlrs from mln dlrs dome said crude oil production in was maintained at prior year s levels through new drilling activity and improvements in productivity natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of lower domestic and export sales it said oil and field natural

slow move to higher u s prime rate quarter point prime rate increases to pct by citibank and chase manhattan bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the federal

e f hutton and co citibank s surprise base rate increase quickly followed by chase sent u s bond prices lower and the dollar higher mcculley said that once the spread between three month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than percentage points there is a strong chance of a prime rate increase it has been under points recently however banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term analysts said they noted that banks historically like to follow fed rate movements rather than lead them for example the last prime rate increase occurred in june when banks lifted the rate to pct from pct after a fed discount rate increase in april of that year major banks had been posting a pct prime rate since last august when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the fed s half point discount rate cut to the current pct level on august the banks will not rush to raise their prime rates there should be a split prime for a while with some posting a pct rate and others pct said david jones of aubrey g lanston and co jones said the federal open market committee at today s meeting voted no change in fed policy but he said the fed may well foster higher interest rates soon jones said that while the fomc probably voted no policy change today it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure

pass said joseph liro of s g warburg and co in a move that came a day earlier than most expected the fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of treasury notes and bonds for its own account this seasonal reserve add is called a pass the fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change said elizabeth reiners economist at dean witter reynolds inc she said the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate is now around basis points compared with a basis point average in reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase the dean witter economist said that today s prime rate rise may have been less a response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the balance sheet bottom line reiners said that given recent problems with loans to developing countries large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans the federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move in raising their prime rates banks cited a higher cost of funds in the three business days through monday the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly pct but quarter end pressures helped push up funds the fed funds rate was extremely volatile today reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the japanese fiscal year funds traded between five and pct once the special distortions end analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the pct area they said that if it

could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices the newest member of the federal reserve board says commodity prices are already considered by the fed in the making of monetary policy but they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by governor robert heller who joined the board last august he conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed but argues that such an arrangement particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries could reduce the volatility of exchange rates moreover it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves slowing changes in inflation his idea which many conservative economists find appealing has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by president reagan it would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation key indicators such as unemployment and the rise or fall of the money supply changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly discussed on and off for a long time the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base what is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes says heller in the past this anchor was gold but the united states went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies a return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the soviet union and south africa the so called fixed rate system scuttled in the early s is still considered unworkable in the present world but the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely adding vast pressures to the monetary system is also being widely questioned some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also for one thing there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy moreover some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement the poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that not surprisingly helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems treasury secretary james baker the reagan administration s chief economic architect has preferred to use the so called group of five industrial countries or sometimes seven as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters he appears convinced that officials from west germany france britain japan italy and canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing the heller approach while extremely complex could have a profound impact on the system ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates as envisioned by heller a basket of say major commodities ranging from wheat to oil would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis in times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices montary policy might be eased he says he notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis moreover most commodity prices are produced consumed and traded on a world wide basis so that an index has a relevance for the entire world he says in addition commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions he says however he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the s because of action by the opec cartel would have to be discounted in such a system he says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities

we have done since there will be none left in years to grow grain on xu jinfeng a middle aged official in fengbang village on the edge of shanghai sums up the dilemma china faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes china has to feed one quarter of the world s population but only one seventh of its land is arable sharp increases in farm output since turned china into a net grain exporter for the first time in and again in but the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them official figures show that china lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in and a slightly smaller amount last year it gained mln new mouths to feed during the two years we lost very little land prior to when the industrialisation began official xu said since then nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up last year we lost land to a new railway line xu said but land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses she added the issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the peking leadership which announced earlier this month that china will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year the present situation of abusing occupying unlawfully wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious said an article in the official press explaining the new measures it has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland it said china has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient an official of the shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only hectares of arable land to other uses while anything more than that must be approved by the city government the peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure china s people get enough grain to eat the prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low making it more profitable for them to grow other crops to offset this the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy the state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to china s mln city residents rural factories also subsidise grain output paying farmers bonuses to grow it some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices chen zuyuan communist party secretary of a village in the eastern province of zhejiang said the government listened too much to the demands of selfish city people and could raise city grain prices without any problem but the government has ruled out a price rise raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability said a china daily editorial this month the shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term we must be very careful we have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises he said the problem is how to do it the shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents in addition the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular the official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves memorial halls for ancestors and homes under reforms introduced in the late s farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land as the expiration date of the year contract is almost at the halfway mark farmers are beginning to worry about the future the china daily said in an editorial last month their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it for most of the period of communist rule the land was organised into collectives where

least one however estimated the company could be taken over in a range of to dlrs per share analysts today would not venture to say whether another offer could be made but some arbitragers still held to the belief that the bidding could go higher they have no choice to seek out the best possible offer emery has shown the courage to go forth said one arbitrager who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders it makes sense said james parker of robinson humphrey but it won t make out as well as they think they won t get a pct of the synergies analysts said the acquisition could cost emery earnings in the short term but long term after eliminating redundancies and selling other purolator assets it should boost emery s profitability parker said a combined

company since purolator agreed in late february to a buyout by some of its management and the e f hutton group efh subsidiary speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come the buyout was surrounded by controversy since a purolator board member doresy gardner resigned in march gardner said he believed a better offer could be made by another entity a spokesman for gardner today said the former director had no contact with emery nor did he have any other buyers lined up for purolator purolator s deal with hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth hearings in a new york state court were delayed until monday arbitragers had said they believed the hutton offer could be bettered because the wall street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in purolator hutton is providing a mln dlr bridge loan that would later be replaced with other debt hutton

congress will go on as before darman s strength was not as an economist but as a political strategist and that s baker s strength too the official said there were already indications that baker who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely knit circle of advisers has moved swiftly to find a successor one possibility is that baker might turn to george gould who holds the number three treasury position of under secretary gould another close confidante has known baker for years before joining the treasury in november gould was a partner at the wall steet firm of wertheim and co and formerly headed donaldson lufkin and jenrette securities corp the darman announcement came on the eve of the semi annual meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank where many policies darman helped shape will be debated he helped baker devise the september plaza agreement when the united states japan west germany france and britain curbed the dollar s strength the pact was a major turning point in u s policy ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets darman also worked on some other baker initiatives like the tokyo summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent paris agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth these policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between japan and west germany s trade surpluses and the united state s massive trade deficit that policy goal still remains a prime objective of the

will discuss strengthening ems float european community finance ministers and central bankers meet in belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening europe s joint currency float amid continuing worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges belgian finance minister mark eyskens who will host the informal talks told reuters the ministers and central bank chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the february agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels in an interview eyskens said he felt the paris accord between the united states japan west germany france britain and canada had proved itself more or less workable but doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a trade war between the united states and japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week the talks at the belgian resort of knokke are being held to coordinate the ec s positions on monetary issues and third world debt ahead of the spring meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington next week the ec gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the european monetary system the joint float holding eight ec currencies within narrow fluctuation bands which will feature high on the weekend agenda eyskens has repeatedly said that europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets and in particular a more stable dollar before it can set about strengthening the ems to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings the ems has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant ems currency the west german mark forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months in the interview eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide ranging discussion on the future of the eight year old ems on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the ec s monetary committee and the committee of central bank governors the committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of ems exchange rates in january eyskens repeated calls for the european currency unit the fledgling ec currency at the core of the system to take over the mark s dominant role in the ems a proposal that has met with a cool response in west germany he said ec commission president jacques delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the nation bloc by such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the ems would be an element of destabilisation in the community he said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the ec s goal of monetary integration on the basis of an ems that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution instead of by national central banks as at present plans for the creation of such an institution foreseen by the ems s founding fathers have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries notably west germany to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field ems development has also been held up by britain s refusal so far to join the system s core exchange rate mechanism reuter"},{"label":"acq","text":"altex aii sets

that would easily deter any suitor one of those being its problems combining its two railroad properties which hang in regulatory limbo richard fischer of merrill lynch and co inc said that santa fe at december had mln dlrs in cash and cash equivalents while its long term debt to capital was just over pct this gives them plenty of borrowing power he said which could be used against an unwanted

showdown between the united states and japan might spread throughout the industrial world but in an interview with reuters conable said the action by the united states to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full scale trade war conable said the world bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth we have in fact been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn t close at the same time he said he said the u s action against japan was a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy the interview came just before next week s semi annual meetings of the bank and the international monetary fund referring to brazil s recent interest payments moratorium conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched he said the bank which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams roads and sewers will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform the bank has increased these loans in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets encouraging foreign investment and reducing government s role in the economy we re comfortable with adjustment lending we expect however that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio conable said he made clear however that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall bank lending for some time he noted the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt conable is a a former republican congressman from new york chosen by president reagan for the bank position last year he is an associate of treasury secertary james baker who launched the u s strategy for shoring up indebted nations in october which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the world bank conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the bank s organization to be completed in the next several weeks he said the decision to seek a reorganization was based in part on the fact that the bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency the reorganization is considered a major initiative by conable and is being closely watched by the agency s member countries as an indication of his management style and priorities i want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow conable said however he said i don t believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and i don t believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose he said however that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by baker has given the bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis conable added that cooperation between the bank and its sister agency the international monetary fund was good and that he talked often with imf managing director michel camdessus on a variety of issues on a personal level conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the bank noting that i don t have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development he added so i don t feel a great calling to personalize the institution on the development needs of sub sahara africa conable said that the bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region noting that half of the recently agreed financing of billion dlrs for bank s international development association was earmarked for africa leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations like those in the sub sahara during next week s meetings reuter"},{"label":"money-fx","text":"u s jobs data said to rule out fed tightening a steep drop in goods producing jobs detracted from u s march non

of to the financial markets expected manufacturing employment fell compared with february s gain while march construction employment dropped after being unchanged in february the momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter said stephen roach of morgan stanley and co inc this sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters the fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy he said they will not ease as long the dollar is weak but clearly they can t tighten david wyss of data resources inc said that the downward revision in february non farm payroll employment to from means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected while wyss left his first quarter forecast of real u s gross national product growth at pct he said the march jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second quarter growth forecast to pct from pct bill sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc said the average monthly gain in non farm jobs in the first quarter was only compared with in the fourth quarter of there s momentum in first quarter labor force activity but less than assumed he said gains in goods producing jobs were subdued at best this rules out any possibilty of the fed tightening for exchange related purposes in march the average workweek fell back to its january level of hours from hours in february manufacturing hours also fell back to their january level totalling hours in march compared with hours in february the commerce department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in march was concentrated in automobile electrical and electronic manufacturing robert brusca of nikko securities international said that a decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs economists said that a build up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first quarter gnp accounts roach said he expects first quarter u s gnp to rise two pct to be followed by a gain of pct at best in the second and third quarters he said the march drop in industrial activity is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to gnp economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for march they expect only marginal gains if not small declines for these indicators compared with a february increases of pct in industrial production and pct in personal income steve slifer of lehman government securities said the drop in march construction employment may also signal a drop in march housing starts which rose pct in february to million units at an annual rate from million units in january the rate of unemployment fell to pct its lowest level since march from pct in february but wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force which fell to mln in march from mln in february this just means that there were fewer people looking for work so the drop in unemployment doesn t mean much he said he said the latest employment report will not concern the fed because it does points to gnp growth in the first half of pct but it does suggest they can t afford to tighten to quickly either the statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated march labor force gains just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in january and february slifer said but are consistent with his forecast of pct first quarter gnp growth economic growth remains sluggish but silfer does not think that the federal open market committee changed policy at their meeting this week at some point they will be more inclined to ease he said for the time being however the march employment

the european monetary system with all that implies belgian finance minister mark eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one day session of informal talks at this belgian coastal resort the gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of ems parities within nine months in january the system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant ems currency the west german mark sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system but eyskens said february s agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the ec to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the ems he told a news conference yesterday s meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among ems member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries they also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable both when they reached their fixed ems limits and within their agreed margins but eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in luxembourg in june on the basis of proposals from the ec s monetary committee and committee of central bank governors he said the ec needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates the belgian minister whose country presently holds the presidency of the community made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the ems towards the ec s long term goal of economic and monetary integration we have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system eyskens said eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the ems has to be reinforced if the ec s plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by are to go ahead ec executive commission president jacques delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in october that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to dedramatise realignments of ems parities by letting high ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers however west german sources said bonn finance minister gerhard stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea british chancellor of the exchequer

in central bank reserves he said several ems member countries believed the ems would work better if central banks held each other s currencies an issue of particular importance regarding west germany since the bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves he said the debate on dedramatising ems realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the january

prices are higher than the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year s pct it said the iea said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels some destocking by end users can be expected if that happens natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels iea estimates on april put oil stocks in the oecd area at mln tonnes representing days of forward consumption this is about the same level as at the begining of the year the agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks it said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by mln bpd in oecd countries in the first quarter of the year this followed a small rise in january of mln bpd but a decline of mln bpd in february and mln bpd in march it is possible that final data will show a larger draw particulary for march it said as crude production also fell there is likely to have also been a decline in non reported stocks particularly at sea the iea said company stocks on land in the oecd rose

consumption world oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to mln bpd from mln bpd in last quarter this drop was mostly due to a decline in opec crude production to around mln bpd in

participants focus on trends in the dollar the economy and federal reserve policy economists said most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains that the dollar has more room to fall and that the fed will keep policy essentially steady perhaps for several months until trends are clearer the market can only attempt to to establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest rates said economists at merrill lynch capital markets merrill lynch economists raymond stone and ward mccarthy said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy investment climate the market will have no confidence in this environment until there is illumination of and confidence in u s dollar trade policy salomon brothers henry kaufman said the bond market highly sensitized to dollar movements could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if u s and overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply the crucial question however is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur kaufman said market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer said philip braverman chief

unexpectedly weak march employment data key year treasury bonds lost points in price for the week as a whole and thursday s pct closing yield was a high braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the pct area provides a basis for optimism bonds closed at pct on friday the irving economist noted that three times last year in a similar paroxysm of pessimism the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high within three to six weeks in each instance however braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by to basis points mitchell held of smith barney harris upham and co inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear which he considers unlikely held said that since late smith barney analysts have spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear naturally that would mean a sharp bond price fall yields could rise further over the next few months but the rise should be less than the basis point rise we ve seen since the start of the year held said most expect fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term the fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance said economists at aubrey g lanston and co inc they said the fed cannot tighten policy and push up interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology that might harm the fragile u s economic expansion the lanston economists said the fed cannot ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and third world debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar minutes of february s federal open market committee fomc meeting released friday showed that while the fomc left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy foreign exchange or credit markets

compared with pct in the international energy agency said oil use in the member countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd increased by around one pct in the first quarter of to mln barrels a day the iea said in its latest monthly report growth in oecd countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels as was the case in but if average consumer prices are higher than the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year s pct the iea said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels some destocking by end users can be expected if that takes place natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in it said iea estimates on april one put oil stocks held in the oecd area at mln tonnes or days of forward consumption this is about the same as at the begining of the year the agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which

mln tonnes against mln in the year on year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising more or less in line with consumption after declining for five years iea said oil

first quarter of the year this followed a small rise in january of bpd but a decline of bpd in february and bpd in march and it is possible that final data will show a larger draw particulary for march it said as crude production also fell there is likely to have also been a decline in non reported stocks particularly at sea the iea said world oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to bpd from bpd in the last quarter of this drop was mostly due to a decline in opec crude production to around bpd in february march from bpd in january and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally planned economies the iea said total opec oil supply totalled bpd in the first quarter of compare with bpd in the last three months of while supply from non opec countries totalled bpd as against bpd in the same period a drop in saudi arabian output to a tentatively forecast bpd in march from bpd in february was the largest factor behind the opec production decline the iea said

goods set to take effect april industry analysts said the move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks the analysts said prices have gone up for memory components the mainstay of the japanese semiconductor industry analyst drew peck of donaldson lufkin and jenrette said but analysts said the price rises have been slight so far and some questioned whether japan would be successful in forcing japanese companies to cut production in the long run others however were more optimistic saying evidence was already in hand that japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs we ve seen the grey market begin to dry up for d rams and it has virtually dried up for eproms said merrill lynch analyst thomas kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching kurlack added industry analysts said japan s ministry of international trade and industry or miti had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year s semiconductor accord with the u s the reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on japanese electronic goods alleging that japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the u s market but some analysts said japan s attempt to mollify the u s was a double edged sword and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the u s as production in japan is cut these analysts argue prices will rise in the u s and few american semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips u s computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured the japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from washington but at the same time they re demonstating their muscle analyst peck said the cut backs in japanese production are expected to benefit u s chip makers i think this could be a very important factor for u s semiconductor manufacturers industry analyst elliot levine of ladenburg thalmann co said but analyst peck said it will take a few weeks to see whether japan has genuinely cut production he said japanese manufactures were likely to view miti s request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write offs in plant and equipment reuter"},{"label":"acq","text":"investors raise stake in purolator

brunthaver president of sparks commodities told a house agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates thereafter government payments should be issued in roughly a split between cash and

alternative case labeled adequate certificate case in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage

in and when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by to pct for the five year period examined government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were billion dlrs or pct less than under the zero certificate case the sparks study said that billion dlrs or pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs the study also
